## Fixes
* Don't reprint the entire listing, it causes bad flickering.
* Listing with more lines than the terminal need to be cut off.

## Features
* Allow --help.
* Allow flags to come after directory in args.
* Vertical column printing (by default?)
* Some form of selection history.
* Load LS_COLORS instead of using our own colors, unless LS_COLORS isn't defined.
* Commands?
